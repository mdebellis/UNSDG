        <description>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.

The SDGs build on decades of work by countries and the UN, including the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs

In June 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, more than 178 countries adopted Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan of action to build a global partnership for sustainable development to improve human lives and protect the environment.
Member States unanimously adopted the Millennium Declaration at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 at UN Headquarters in New York. The Summit led to the elaboration of eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to reduce extreme poverty by 2015.
The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development and the Plan of Implementation, adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in South Africa in 2002, reaffirmed the global community&apos;s commitments to poverty eradication and the environment, and built on Agenda 21 and the Millennium Declaration by including more emphasis on multilateral partnerships.
At the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in June 2012, Member States adopted the outcome document &quot;The Future We Want&quot; in which they decided, inter alia, to launch a process to develop a set of SDGs to build upon the MDGs and to establish the UN High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The Rio +20 outcome also contained other measures for implementing sustainable development, including mandates for future programmes of work in development financing, small island developing states and more.
In 2013, the General Assembly set up a 30-member Open Working Group to develop a proposal on the SDGs.
In January 2015, the General Assembly began the negotiation process on the post-2015 development agenda. The process culminated in the subsequent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with 17 SDGs at its core, at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015.
2015 was a landmark year for multilateralism and international policy shaping, with the adoption of several major agreements:
Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (March 2015)
Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development (July 2015)
Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 SDGs was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York in September 2015.
Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015)
Now, the annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development serves as the central UN platform for the follow-up and review of the SDGs.
Today, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans, urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing States. DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach activities relating to the SDGs. In order to make the 2030 Agenda a reality, broad ownership of the SDGs must translate into a strong commitment by all stakeholders to implement the global goals. DSDG aims to help facilitate this engagement.

The development activities undertaken by CASP has grown in capability, organization, infrastructure to include in its projects, aspects of health, nutrition, education, training, income generation, rural banking and reconstruction, community mobilization, women empowerment and age care. The focus of CASP is the total social development of the people. Today, as CASP stands on the threshold of a new era that will usher in the golden years, its horizon has an expanding vision of hope to look upto. The national NGO with its dedicated team of social workers, has given a new connotation to social welfare and community development, by imbibing eternal values of care, concern, hope and humanitarianism in their true sense, in its lexicon. CASP is committed not only to the welfare of children alone but also believes in the well-being of its employees. For CASP, its employees are the precious assets of the organization to spread its wings far and wide. If it were not for the staff&apos;s dedication, and devotion, CASP would not have achieved national and international recognition as a reputed NGO, committed to child and community development. Equally important is the spirit of volunteerism and leadership provided by eminent persons like Late Shri B. G. Deshmukh, IAS (Retd.), former Cabinet secretary to the Government of India.</hasNGOName>

Intellectually challenged students go to a special school or no school at all depending on the financial situation of parents. These students spend their formative years learning basic, functional academics that will not help them get or keep a job. At the age of 14, they leave school, ill-prepared to deal with lifeâ€™s challenges. They then spend most of their time in front of the television slowly forgetting whatever they have learned. There were very few life skill training options available to challenged young adults, particularly the intellectually challenged.</hasNGOName>

It was conceived as a tripartite partnership between the government, corporate sector and the voluntary sector with the mission: â€œEvery child in school and learning wellâ€. The government took the lead in setting up the organization and allowing access to its schools; corporate leaders lent financial support and, community volunteers assisted in implementing the programs. In many ways, this is a unique model with a built-in capacity to address change at a mass scale.</hasNGOName>

With this Vision, it selected in the begining Pre--school education. With the help of paid volunteers it opened 100&apos;s of pre-schools called Balwadis in most of the slums of Bangalore and lateron in Hubli and Dharwad. It made educated girls and women in and around slums to run these Balwadies for a nominal payment for 3 years and lateron transfer the ownership to them to run in their own houses. Lateron in partership with Women and Child Deptt., of Govt.Karnataka it selected the education component of Anganwadi Programme and brought about qualitative change in the pre-school education in about 1530 Anganwadis of Bangalore. Akshara occupies a premier place in pre-school education in the Country as it is being called to represent Govt. in several conferences and Seminars.Akshara also works closely with Education Deptt., Govt. of Karnataka. In partnership with Govt. it developed several programmes: Reading skills in Kannada and Urdu, Math, English, Library and Technology programme called KLP for using the mass data received by Govt. and other like minded NGOs and generate reports for use by all free of cost. For.eg. it has developed GPS technology of all the Primaray Schools of Karnataka and anybody can access details of any school details like No.of Children in the school-boys &amp; girls, what infrastrure facilities are available etc., by going to its website-klp.org.inAll the programmes of Akshara are child centric and scaleble and sustainable. Govt. of Karnataka has already distributed Reading Cards in Kannada developed with Akshara to all the Govt. primaray schools in Karnataka. It has accepted its Math programme and called it&apos;Ganitha Kalika Andolana&apos; and the same would be implemented in the entire state.

Initially a single-room drop-in centre, AAWC eventually developed into a resource centre to better address the womenâ€™s needs, providing them with professional counseling, medical care, micro-savings facilities, and other services â€“ the Umeed (&quot;hope&quot;) program. As AAWCâ€™s outreach team developed a regular home-visit schedule, they realised that the daughters of Umeed women were at great risk of being coerced into prostitution due to their extensive exposure to the brothel system and to their lack of educational opportunities. As a result, the Udaan (&quot;flight&quot;) program launched in October 2000 to prevent second-generation trafficking. In June 2002, AAWC expanded its services to include the young toddlers of women as well through the launch of the Umang (&quot;joy&quot;) program. Today, AAWC operates two centres, one in the Khetwadi lanes and another in the Kamathipura lanes, two communities which together comprise the largest and oldest red light district in Asia. As of March 2013, the organisation has served more than 1,500 women, 650 girls and 400 toddlers. Alumni of AAWC&apos;s programs include a financial analyst, teacher, medical compounder, dance instructor, photographer, retail executive, social workers, beauticians, chefs at an international luxury five-star hotel, and even a scholarship student at an American university / one of Newsweek â€™s â€œ25 Under 25 Women in the World</hasNGOName>

        <hasNGOVision rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Modern India is growing and developing at an astounding rate. As technology advances to match that of an international standard, so too science and medicine are progressing in leaps and bounds to try to tackle the endless list of challenges and ailments of a modern world. However hand in hand with such advances comes a phenomenal growth in population (India, being the fastest growing country in the world, is predicted to overtake china by population before the middle of this century) and the difficulties and strains that come from overcrowding. As more and more generations of people move to the cities to seek work and a better life so government attention is focused on maintaining these heaving metropolises. Even though there is a migration towards urban living, Tamil Nadu still holds over half its population in rural areas (51.55% rural to 48.45% urban, source: 2011 Census of India). Although less polluted than urban, rural life gives less access to the basic needs such as health care and education often purely down to the distances needed to travel and transport issues, a common theme in such isolated areas is to find children working hard just to help feed their families and education will become secondary. Thus life becomes about surviving rather than thriving.</hasNGOVision>

It was created as a Community Service Centre for providing educational, health and vocational skills to the families living in the slum communities of Navi Mumbai. We currently operate 6 urban and 5 rural centres in Maharashtra, serving approximately 2,000 beneficiaries. In our Vikas project, we aim at setting up a new community centre in the urban slum of Rabale in Navi Mumbai, for families of the migrant workers. The focus will be on educating and building awareness among urban communities about issues relating to the rights and responsibilities concerning their children, themselves and the society they live in. The children that will be supported by our program belong to underprivileged migrant backgrounds, and are typically on the verge of dropping out from their schools. We will provide them with support classes in subjects like Math, English, Science and Computers and cultural activities. They will also receive daily mid-day meals and regular check-ups in Health camps. We plan to conduct awareness programmes to eliminate child labour. Most of the women of these communities are uneducated and unskilled. They are unable to get decently paid jobs/work and are often exploited by their families and the neighbourhood. They are forced into the flesh trade when their husbands abandon them. Parents do not welcome the birth of daughters. Our project will empower girls through education and personality development courses, along with sensitizing the community about gender equality, respect for girls and other such values.</hasNGOName>

        <hasNGOName rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">We are a community-based, volunteer-driven organization that offers after-school activities and engagements for young minds. We engage children in development-based activities that creatively engage them and keep them off the streets after school hours. We teach them, but that&apos;s not all we do. We provide a platform for children to connect, share, learn and grow. We try to fill in the void in the curricular and extra-curricular growth and development- that is not available to these children at home. We have a completely volunteer-driven approach so we have our volunteers (and kudos to them!) impart knowledge and skills, counsel the troubled kids, listen to them or just spend time with them, all in a community park! Our unique learning process ensures that open spaces help in making children comfortable without introducing the dread associated with classrooms while saving hugely on operational costs. The freedom associated with outdoors is also conducive for a healthier environment. The vagaries of the Delhi weather do not deter our little brave-hearts, who turn up everyday, come rain, sun or freezing cold! The community-based structure ensures that children look forward to this comfortably-paced interaction with their peer group as well, while the parents can also get involved or just observe from the sidelines, if they so wish. Sometimes the parents are happy to learn too, so we have started a literacy class for them too! We ensure that there&apos;s something for everybody to do. Currently, we have 10 volunteers and more than 75 kids from a Jhuggi-Jhopdi cluster who come in everyday and learn a little and teach us a lot.</hasNGOName>

We provide medical aid in India and in neighboring countries, irrespective of race, creed or political persuasion. In that capacity, we have operated in twenty one states and two union territories across India. Over the last two years, we have already delivered more than Rs 21 Crores worth of free essential medicines and medical assistance to more than 80 affiliate partners (charity hospitals and community medical programs). AmeriCares India Foundation also accomplishes its mission by operating medical camps in urban slums and rural tribal areas. Our mobile medical camps provide free medical consultation and free quality medicines to urban slums and rural poor. In addition we raise awareness about disease prevention, health promotion programs, educate children on the importance of proper hygiene techniques. As a disaster relief organization we respond to all major disasters such as the earthquakes ( e.g. Sikkim 2011), floods (e.g. Orissa 2011), avalanches (e.g. Jammu &amp; Kashmir 2012) or cyclones (e.g. West Bengal 2010). Our disaster preparedness workshops have given first responders, lay people and healthcare professionals training that enabled them to take timely and effective action during emergencies. We also conduct disaster medical training programs for hospitals â€“ preparing them for both internal and external emergencies. This work is made possible by soliciting donations of cash, medicines, medical supplies and other relief materials from Indian and multinational pharmaceutical manufacturers based in India. Our modern warehouse and prepositioned stock enables us to mount an immediate response and deliver aid quickly to those in need.</hasNGOName>

The society was registered soon afterwards in May, 1982. Arguably CHEA is one of the earliest societies founded in Northern India which had &apos; the environment and the livelihood of the people in the Himalayas &apos; as its core concern. Much water has flown in the great Himalayan rivers and the Indian Himalayas have since been witness to much distress, conflict, degradation, demographic dynamics, political restructuring and impacts of various global revolutions and their regional and local impacts. CHEA has since espoused many mountain causes, engaged itself actively in scores of action-researches on human and environmental aspects and livelihood-related projects and continues to be so involved to this day. Since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 with the inclusion of Chapter 13- &apos;Managing Fragile Ecosystems : Sustainable Mountain Development&apos; in the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) the importance of mountain social-ecological systems have been acknowledged for the first time on a global scale. Establishment of CHEA, let it be recalled, pre-dated the Rio Summit by more than a full decade. Certainly the perceptions of a seminar organised in October 1983 by CHEA in participation of academicians, activists and scientist to se the future course of action for the Indian Himalayas has to be re-evaluated in context of the insights the world at large and the Indian sub-continent in particular has gained and with which CHEA has a re-alignment of its strategy for the 21st century, both in context of local and global priorities. To ensure solution of increasing pressure on natural resource for rural livelihoods CHEA has developed strategies for stregthaning grassroots environmental governance and undertaking action research.</hasNGOName>

We enable safe communities where children, adults and governments work together to prevent and respond to the harm that these children face. Aangan works to strengthen or build child protection mechanisms that both prevent as well as respond to childrenÂ exploitation and threats to their security and wellbeing. Our prevention work is located in urban bastis or slums where impoverished children and families are supported and empowered to create a safe environment for children. Our work is centered around children who are normally invisible, such as children hidden away in childcare institutions; working adolescents who do not have the benefit of protection under inadequate labour laws; out of school children who are isolated in their homes or at work in the informal sector, children engaging in illegal and risky activities. We believe that if children, adults and state authorities engage with one another to identify, build and strengthen mechanisms that ensure childrenÂ protection, then communities will be safe for all children. We work with the state to implement effective legislation and create a protective environment in which young people are not only physically and emotionally safe, but are also able to secure justice and essential services.</hasNGOName>

Shanta Gandhi, an educator with eclectic interests, and diverse training in science, theatre, dance and politics had started working with a group of children in order to develop a curriculum that had relevance to their lives. The atmosphere was informal and the curriculum not pre-planned. It evolved naturally in response to the needs of that group and as a result of her interaction with those children. Children asked questions about their surroundings, and the process of finding answers (through games, songs and discussion) led naturally to questions regarding human evolution - how life emerged, why we are what we are, how our lives have changed from the past, and so on. Later, the curriculum was further developed in an experimental school attached to the B.M. Institute of Child Psychology and Development in Ahmedabad in the late 1950s. Here again, it was not based directly on the formal school curriculum but supplemented it. After a long interval, the programme was taken up in the 1970s at the Bal Bhavan, in New Delhi. Children who came there were provided an opportunity to interact with teachers, writers and artists, and to explore their surroundings through art, drama and dance, while all the time asking questions and discovering the answers. Unfortunately there was another long break before the programme was revived in Mumbai in the 1990s. Since then, the Avehi Abacus Project has developed three integrated packages of educational materials for students and teachers in the formal as well as the non-formal streams of learning</hasNGOName>
